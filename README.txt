Stanford Carousel
==================

This module implements a carousel slideshow based on Twitter Bootstrap. It consists of a view, CSS, and JS.  It depends on a content type, Stanford Slide.

Choose a display block for presenting caption styles. Use the slide content type to configure caption position and color. Use the class "carousel-autoplay" on the block class to have your carousel autoplay (not recommended).

Only place one carousel per page. Placing multiple carousels on the same page may lead to undesirable results.
